2/22-4/30: Agile Development project
The goal is to take a project from ideation to completion, ensuring progress in building the code every day!
Organize regular “scrum” meetings at which everyone participates, evaluate progress and obstacles, plan on how to move ahead.
Establish procedures to voice and overcome disagreements, not ignoring anyone in the team.
Start with just a project proposal, meet with customers as needed, develop specification and design documents as you build the code.
Reassign work as needed, especially when obstacles are encountered.


4/1-29: Industry Presentations
Software professionals from several companies will be coming to talk about their real-world (current or recent) experiences, and the software engineering processes used by their organizations.
Some of them may be recruiters!  So:
Dress professionally, pretending that they may be interviewing you.
Look interested, ask questions.
Take notes (pen and paper).
Talk to them after class, if needed.

At the end of each presentation, you’ll have to write a paragraph summarizing what they talked about, in relation to what you’ve learnt in CIS453 & CIS454 (10% of the course grade).
